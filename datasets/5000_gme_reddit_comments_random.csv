As far as vote totals, we initially thought that an overvote would expose all the naked shorts, but we learned from Dr. Trimbath and Lucy Komisar, that it is standard procedure by the tabulators to trim off all the extra votes when an overvote occurs. We still ended up with a voting total comprising the entire float, which is obviously impossible, considering many institutions don't vote their shares, and I'm sure there were plenty of shareholders who didn't vote as well. This means we likely had a big overvote, that was trimmed down.The vote total ended up being exactly what we expected it to be, and is further proof that our thesis is correct.

[I am having the same dilemma. I starting buying PINS at IPO ~$26 and then doubled down when it dropped to $14 in 2020. I saw massive gains through the spring of 2021, but the last two quarters have had me worrying about management's competence. The Paypal debacle is the most recent example of actions by management hurting shareholders.   My biggest beef is they are failing at telling the growth story of Pinterest. Analysts are valuing it in the same way that they value Twitter and SNAP, and the platform is nothing like those two companies.    Currently, I am going to hold through earnings next Thursday. If the stock gets slaughtered again like it has the last two calls, and management sounds confused or clueless, I am taking whatever profits I have left and cashing out. I hate to do it, because I think it's a unique platform that isn't easily replicated, and they have a sticky userbase, but if management can't deliver, I will look for better investment opportunities.     PINS could very well get acquired by someone down the line, but I don't want to sit here and wait for that to happen.

The rumour is that they did this because they already had a mass of naked short positions (a short bet that they never covered. This artificially inflates the float (the total amount of shares).

People are now theorising that if they buy the entire real float of shares up and use a service that computerstoxk provides to directly register their share (get a certificate to prove ownership) then they will lock up the real float and force the hedgefunds to finally buy back all of their fake shares.

GME pre fuckery with -10$ dip at 4a.m. on 953 vol, recovering since then, but c'mon! ‚úÖ

Futures +/- flat ‚úÖ

0 shares available to borrow at IBRK + rate increased .1 to 0.7% ‚úÖ

Technical indicators cooling off (temporarily) ‚úÖ

So the weird pre drop is likely a scare tactic to make apes believe people are selling, but it was really just those few shares used to weirdly large effect.

Expecting this to become 0 around opening and then battle around max pain.

What's more important bigger picture, yesterday with the help of some other apes I gained some wrinkles around the SEC report. While it lacked action, it basically confirmed all of our DD. Specifically:

1) Hedgie buy volume was much too low to cover &gt;100% float short = they didn't cover shit

2) Shitadel &amp; Co. internalized 80% of volume in Jan = they are sitting on a huge IOU pile ex clearing

3) Buying on lit exchange increased price while dark pool or internalized did not = buy via IEX, NYSE, or CS/DRS works

4) Options + ETF fuckery was used on top of everything else

If I wasn't all in already and buying with every paycheck, I would go all in now. No financial advice. But it's obvious now hedgies + MMs + brokers are FUK!",0.8395,8,"superstonk:8:Good morning apes!

hgwk3t6,1634417667,"&gt; It is scare in the fact that only 21 million bitcoin can be mined.

There are infinitely many altcoin substitutions. There are also infinitely many possible hard forks.

&gt; Also, those hard forks only lend support to bitcoin. Look at their relative market caps, look at their adoption.

Market cap doesn't pick the winner. The early killer app for Bitcoin was criminal activity on darknet markets. The altcoin that took over these markets is Monero, which is worth *less* than Bitcoin Cash. Monero is probably one of the most useful blockchains right now. It can function for its purpose (crime) at basically any price so the market cap doesn't really reflect usage there. If a cryptocurrency is functioning as a currency, then you can just buy/sell it immediately into something else once you're done using it.

&gt; As time continues bitcoin will only take more market share from other altcoins. It is the first digitally scare asset and everything else is a replica of it. The hark forks and other alts lack the same branding, adoption, decentralization and the same global vested interest in its success.

History seems to suggest the opposite. The money in cryptocurrency is made by being earlier than everyone else so everyone wants to get into altcoins, driving interest no matter how ridiculous the altcoin is.

It's likely that at some point Ethereum will pass Bitcoin in market cap, too, because Ethereum is infinitely more useful as a platform. This doesn't make it a good bet, though, because this could be *after* both coins crash 90%.

&gt; Also the innovation in finance is it's solution to the double-spend problem. And thats fucking huge.

It's a solution for a distributed, trustless method of consensus. Most people don't need trustless finance. If you have a trusted, centralized authority, then double-spend is trivial to solve, at basically no environmental cost.

And the future of blockchains is finding *considerably* more efficient (and thus considerably more environmentally friendly) alternative solutions. The future of blockchains is moving *beyond* proof of work and Bitcoin will never move beyond PoW.

&gt; Why do you keep bringing up GME and AMC into your argument about bitcoin?

Because they have higher recent returns than most cryptocurrencies (and for cryptocurrencies, just look at Dogecoin for high recent returns) and because their currently-high market caps are not justified by any fundamentals.

&gt; Again blockchains are extremely useful in finance. Our entire global banking system is built on a third party verification solution to the double-spend problem. Blockchain very simply removes the need of a third party which has huge ramifications in reducing cost, making finance more safe and accessible.

With Bitcoin's proof of work? Absolutely not. The *entire* point of proof of work is to use *as much cost* as possible to make it hard for a hostile entity to take over the blockchain.

&gt; However the market has already decided that bitcoin is the winner

You should look up what the #1 stock in the world by market cap is over time. If you think that this is a new class of assets, next to equities, then it's unlikely that the winner will remain the same in the long run. It's not a race where once you cross the finish line it's over: it's a continual competition.",0.986,1,"buttcoin:1:&gt; It is scare in the fact that only 21 million bitcoin can be mined.

There are infinitely many altcoin substitutions. There are also infinitely many possible hard forks.

&gt; Also, those hard forks only lend support to bitcoin. Look at their relative market caps, look at their adoption.

Market cap doesn't pick the winner. The early killer app for Bitcoin was criminal activity on darknet markets. The altcoin that took over these markets is Monero, which is worth *less* than Bitcoin Cash. Monero is probably one of the most useful blockchains right now. It can function for its purpose (crime) at basically any price so the market cap doesn't really reflect usage there.

hgptsyv,1634287442,"On the stock market it's possible to do something called ""shorting"". What this means is that you sell a stock and collect money for the sale immediately. However, unlike a normal sale, you don't actually own the stock that you just sold. Instead, you borrow it from another entity.

The reason you would do this is that you think that the price of the stock is going to go down. So think of it like this:

The price of apples is $1 each at the farmer's market. I think that the price of apples is going to fall to $0.50, so I want to ""short"" the sale. I call my friend Farmer Bob and ask to borrow 100 apples to sell, and I promise to give back 100 apples to him later, when the price of the apples is cheaper.

So I sell my 100 apples for $100. The next day, the price of apples goes down to $.50 like I predicted. In order to ""close my short position"", I have to buy 100 apples for $50 and give those apples to Farmer Bob. He has his apples back, and I made a $50 profit.

That's the basic premise behind shorting a stock.

In this case, what is going on is that certain large financial institutions known as hedge funds have shorted GameStop stock (GME). This is nothing new- however, back around mid 2020 some people started to uncover evidence that pointed to the possibility that hedge funds had been shorting *too much* of GME's stock. In other words, they were borrowing shares that *don't really exist*. This is called ""naked shorting"", and it's illegal.

The hedge funds wanted to short so much of the stock that the price would collapse down to zero and GameStop would go bankrupt. That way, they would never have to close their position-- all of those borrowed shares that they sold would cease to exist, but they would get to keep all of the money they made from shorting. Normally, this is an easy way to get filthy rich (albeit an illegal one). 

The difference this time is that people got wind of what was going on and starting buying and HOLDING shares (not selling, only buying and keeping them). It gets complicated quickly, but the gist of it is that this makes it more difficult for hedge funds to continue shorting and to close their positions. 

Remember the apple example? If I borrow 100 apples and sell them at $1 each thinking that the price will go down, I can make money easily. But what if the price goes up? If apples suddenly cost $10 each, I still have to buy 100 of them and give them back to Farmer Bob, but instead of making a profit I'm actually paying ten times what I made from shorting the stock.

Hedge funds shorted GME in the single dollar range, and now the price is close to $200. What that means is that for every shorted share, in order to pay back what they have borrowed they would be taking an enormous loss. 

Some estimates put the number of shorted shares at levels several times higher than the total number of GME shares that are supposed to exist.

What that means is, essentially, if and when the hedge funds start to finally close their positions, they're going to have to buy back ALL of those shares at a much higher price than they initially sold them for. When that happens, the price of the stock skyrockets, and anybody holding GME can potentially sell for a massive profit. This is what's called a ""short squeeze"", and historically they can cause stock price to go to astronomical places.

I'm leaving out a ton of stuff involving specific technical analysis and direct share registration, because I wanted to just give you a good general summary. The most basic way I can put it is that the people here believe and are betting that GME is illegally shorted well past the point of absurdity, and that eventually when the dominoes start to fall, anyone holding GME could potentially sell for hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars.

It's not a proven thing, but there is an almost literal mountain of evidence (called ""DD"", or ""due diligence"") here on superstonk as well on other GME subs that you can read at your leisure.

If you're still mystified, here's what you can do: read up on this and then make a decision for yourself if you want to be involved. If you do, buy a share directly through ComputerShare, which is GameStop's official registrar. That share will be registered in your name and you will have exclusive ownership of it. I can't make any promises regarding potential profits or losses, but speaking as someone who has been on this roller coaster since early January, I would tell *anyone* with $200 to spare that, *in my opinion*, they should buy one share of GME now and see what happens. Worst case scenario, you lose a couple hundred bucks. Best case scenario, that single share could make you rich some day. Is it a guarantee? No, but this situation is unlike anything seen before on the stock market so it's very exciting and, really, anything could happen.

Hope that helps!",0.9963,1,"superstonk:1:On the stock market it's possible to do something called ""shorting"". What this means is that you sell a stock and collect money for the sale immediately. However, unlike a normal sale, you don't actually own the stock that you just sold. Instead, you borrow it from another entity.

The reason you would do this is that you think that the price of the stock is going to go down. So think of it like this:

The price of apples is $1 each at the farmer's market. I think that the price of apples is going to fall to $0.50, so I want to ""short"" the sale. I call my friend Farmer Bob and ask to borrow 100 apples to sell, and I promise to give back 100 apples to him later, when the price of the apples is cheaper.

So I sell my 100 apples for $100. The next day, the price of apples goes down to $.50 like I predicted. In order to ""close my short position"", I have to buy 100 apples for $50 and give those apples to Farmer Bob. He has his apples back, and I made a $50 profit.

That's the basic premise behind shorting a stock.

In this case, what is going on is that certain large financial institutions known as hedge funds have shorted GameStop stock (GME). This is nothing new- however, back around mid 2020 some people started to uncover evidence that pointed to the possibility that hedge funds had been shorting *too much* of GME's stock. In other words, they were borrowing shares that *don't really exist*. This is called ""naked shorting"", and it's illegal.

The hedge funds wanted to short so much of the stock that the price would collapse down to zero and GameStop would go bankrupt. That way, they would never have to close their position-- all of those borrowed shares that they sold would cease to exist, but they would get to keep all of the money they made from shorting. Normally, this is an easy way to get filthy rich (albeit an illegal one). 

The difference this time is that people got wind of what was going on and starting buying and HOLDING shares (not selling, only buying and keeping them). It gets complicated quickly, but the gist of it is that this makes it more difficult for hedge funds to continue shorting and to close their positions. 

Remember the apple example? If I borrow 100 apples and sell them at $1 each thinking that the price will go down, I can make money easily. But what if the price goes up? If apples suddenly cost $10 each, I still have to buy 100 of them and give them back to Farmer Bob, but instead of making a profit I'm actually paying ten times what I made from shorting the stock.

Hedge funds shorted GME in the single dollar range, and now the price is close to $200. What that means is that for every shorted share, in order to pay back what they have borrowed they would be taking an enormous loss. 

Some estimates put the number of shorted shares at levels several times higher than the total number of GME shares that are supposed to exist.

What that means is, essentially, if and when the hedge funds start to finally close their positions, they're going to have to buy back ALL of those shares at a much higher price than they initially sold them for. When that happens, the price of the stock skyrockets, and anybody holding GME can potentially sell for a massive profit. This is what's called a ""short squeeze"", and historically they can cause stock price to go to astronomical places.

I could be wrong, but if RC is as wrinkly as I think he is (oh he is), a part of the meaning  might go something like this:

1.) Yes, it‚Äôs a reply to RobbingHood directly - that‚Äôs why it was posted from GameStop‚Äôs twitter feed: Company v company.

2.) RobbingHood halted GME from trading in Jan, essentially deciding to ‚Äùfight‚Äù GME on what was rightfully theirs, so... ‚Äù1v1 me bro‚Äù. ‚ÄùFight me - I‚Äôm against you‚Äù : That‚Äôs an ultimate turn-off for RC and GameStop... as it should be.

3.) ‚Äù1v1‚Äù is almost an M-shape... right? Look at GME‚Äôs graph from the 27th of Jan onwards during the Sneeze - also an M-shape at the peak. This is further pointing towards RobbingHood, but this would be a very weak argument...

I could be wrong, but if RC is as wrinkly as I think he is (oh he is), a part of the meaning  might go something like this:

1.) Yes, it‚Äôs a reply to RobbingHood directly - that‚Äôs why it was posted from GameStop‚Äôs twitter feed: Company v company.

2.) RobbingHood halted GME from trading in Jan, essentially deciding to ‚Äùfight‚Äù GME on what was rightfully theirs, so... ‚Äù1v1 me bro‚Äù. ‚ÄùFight me - I‚Äôm against you‚Äù : That‚Äôs an ultimate turn-off for RC and GameStop... as it should be.

3.) ‚Äù1v1‚Äù is almost an M-shape... right? Look at GME‚Äôs graph from the 27th of Jan onwards during the Sneeze - also an M-shape at the peak. This is further pointing towards RobbingHood, but this would be a very weak argument...

It sounds bad at first, but another part of bail-in laws that isn't properly addressed in the DD is how banks reimburse you for the uninsured money they take from your accounts with shares from their own banks.

But how are they going to be able to do that without resorting to making numerous fake shares?

Take the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), for example, with over 450M shares in existence at $145 CAD right now; putting them at a market cap of over $65B.

Without even accounting for insider and institutional holdings of the total number of shares, when GME reaches MOASS heights of even $10K, they're only going to be able to give out 6.5M shares for GME holders alone at the most.

Let's look at coding from the perspective of both kids and adults.  And let's consider a reasonable approach that won't bore anyone out of their minds.

Ground rules:

* whatever you want to work on should be accomplished in six months or less, anything longer and you'd lose interest
* NO GAMES!  (no, really, games are way too hard to teach to beginners.  one would have to understand fairly sophisticated asynchronous techniques, complex event handling, multiplexing input sources, modeling framework, computational framework, output framework, OS details, etc. etc. etc.)

Having said that, for kids and beginning adults, the most attractive form of computing is probably going to be ""physical computing"".  What is physical computing?  It's a kind of computing that you do on low-cost microcontrollers (like an Arduino) that has direct interface to the physical world.  You push a button, something lights up.  You cover a light sensor, something turns on.  There is no operating system here.  It's you, your code, and the physical world.  It's programming stripped to the very purest form.

How to get started?

The easiest way to get started is via Python, an interpreted language.  You can take free courses on [codeacademy.org](https://codeacademy.org) and pick up basic Python knowledge first.  When you have enough Python skills, you can pick up a microcontroller board like the ""Circuit Playground Express"" from Adafruit and go from there.

With a microcontroller like the ""Circuit Playground Express"", you can turn colorful RGBs on and off, make patterns, make sound, respond to buttons, take temperature readings, etc.

The microcontroller on that board can also emulate keyboard / mouse, so once you gain enough experience and want to try on more-advanced programming (still within the realm of physical computing) you can create all kinds of interesting things, for example, how about a little widget that plays a song/light show based on how you shake it, and maybe types in a (low security) password based on specific tap patterns?

Two scenarios

1.  Let's say you have 25 GME shares in etrade, worth 1 million each. Etrade goes under and the insurance only covers 500k, and the assets are not moved to a new broker. Instead there is a complete liquidation. 

Outcome: 100% - in the event of a broker default, you get a check for 500k instead of 25 million.

2. Same scenario but your shares are in your own name at Computershare. A transfer agent doesn't take on risk like a broker does so the chance of default is highly unlikely. But, for the sake of argument, let's say they do go under. There's still a paper trail that you're the owner, and that ownership can be transferred to another transfer agent.

Outcome:  in the event that computershare goes bankrupt, ganestop will be forced to move to a new transfer agent. if ownership of your shares, for some reason, cannot be traced to you, such as computershare's computers being wiped or you lose your paper records, you get nothing. This is extremely unlikely. More likely is that your ownership will be recorded by the new transfer agent. Most likely is that nothing happens to computershare. 

In the event of computershare default... 

1% - you get nothing and you lose ownership 

99% - somehow computershare goes under and your ownership is moved to the new transfer agent by GME. You still get 25 million.

Although I wasn't an RH customer, I bought those the day before with plans to probably sell mid-day the next day.. and then they all suddenly cratered in unprecedented fashion due to their treachery. I managed to sell in a hurry in the morning, but not before losing thousands which they effectively took from me.

heyxvqc,1633093189,"&gt; Do you think that institutions have an incentive to misrepresent SI% data if it affects their positions?

No.  The ""institutions"" reporting on  such data are not the investors holding or shorting stocks.  There is literally no evidence that current short interest is anything other than what is reported.

&gt; Do you think that 30%-60% of volume ocurring in dark pools and off lit exchanges is corrupt?

No. The entire point of dark pool trading is so large institutional investors can move stock *without* causing wild swings in stock prices, usually devaluation.    While there is, of course, a possibility of fraud at any part of any financial process flow, there is again no evidence that stocks like GME are being manipulated.  If dark pool trading worked the way you guys think it did, the price of the stock would be a hell of a lot lower.

&gt; Do you think regulators are in bed with wall streets hedge funds, banks etc?

Not really, no. Regulators across all industries often don't punish bad actors to the degree necessary to change behaviour, but that is not the same thing as being part of a giant conspiracy.   Likewise, I don't believe Jeff Bezos gives a shit about GME, nor that the Rothschilds or ((they)) are manipulating your stock or any other little conspiracy you guys invent to explain why you aren't billionaires today.

The simple fact is, what happened in January *did* alter the playing field.  And that is why short interest in GME has cratered.  Because you guys represent a new risk factor in how the market works for stocks that gain meme status.

Ultimately, you guys are actually learning how the stock market works.  Namely, that the typical trading day involves small fluctuations of price rises and falls as people routinely buy and sell the stock.  As far as MOASS goes though?  Literally none of the conditions that allowed January to happen are in place today.  And ironically, the more you guys focus on the stock, the less likely it is that this will change.",-0.9218,1,"gme_meltdown:1:&gt; Do you think that institutions have an incentive to misrepresent SI% data if it affects their positions?

GameStop has no legitimate association with Loopring. The appearance of a connection is the result, I believe, of a scam run by Finestone and friends to promote their non-GameStop related projects and pump the Loopring shitcoin. GameStop has never corroborated Finestone's claim to work for them.

hd8f9u7,1631901193,"This is not financial advice, but from my personal opinion you made the right call.

First and foremost you can feel safe knowing GME is the value play regardless of squeeze potential. 

Of course, I like most other apes in the GME crowd believe a MOASS has passed the point of no return, but GME is a ridiculously undervalued stock by any metric.

The leadership, team and what shapes out to be the pivot strategy for GME is nothing short of something I firmly believe will go down as an educational example for business schools and entrepreneurship courses for generations to come. 

As someone who have worked with entrepreneurship for most of my adult life, I can honestly and without hyperbole say NOTHING the GME leadership under RC have done have been anything less than excellent - be it the changing up of the board, recruiting top notch people to execute masterfully made strategies, using the situation to fill their war chest without giving way to the SHF, the list goes on and on.

The same can not be said about the popcorn stock. I have yet to se *anything* done by the leadership of that company which gives any indication of a solid turnaround plan, in fact quite the contrary: after diluting the float even further (as others have pointed out, popcorn stock had a way bloated float compared to GME to begin with) the leadership under AA went ahead and bought more physical locations in addition to the existing ones, which themselves weren‚Äôt going in the green. That *strategy* is either the result of some seriously outdated and bad management, or part of a known play by planted management to sink already struggling companies in further debts to deliver the coup de gr√¢ce on behalf of their SHF masters.
Either way, it does not at all foster belief in the company as a value play, nor as leadership with their shareholders best interest at heart.

And this is where I feel a lot of the popcorn holders who tout the ‚Äúape no fight ape‚Äù to anyone speaking a critical word about popcorn fail to grasp: it‚Äôs not about GME apes wanting to degrade or ‚Äúfight‚Äù popcorn apes - we just truly don‚Äôt see a fraction of the value or squeeze potential in that stock. And no, I don‚Äôt give a shit what anybody use their money on, I would never tell anyone what to do with their hard earned cash - what I do feel, strongly, is that the *only* way holding popcorn stock should play into a short squeeze these days are as a potential swing trade into more, or ones first, GME. It‚Äôs really that simple.

I personally bought popcorns with my broker dust instead of buying fractionals knowing that all the MSM hype and FOMOing by a horde of folks barely understanding what shorting means would lead to ramping of the price - and I sold for more GME @60. 

Disclaimer: I am in no way, shape or form ripping on new traders with lacking experience making less than informed choices - most of us were dumb as shit when starting this wild ride, and most of us still are. I am however taking a big steaming shit on folks who, if they‚Äôve used the extraordinary well of knowledge available through all this awesome DD, still can say there is no difference between GME and popcorn - them folks are just plain retarded, or just pretending to know how to read.

A dark pool is an off-market exchange, where one party can sell or buy shares of a stock without affecting the market price. This prevents price discovery and essentially ensures that the entire market is a fraudulent casino.

Hedge funds like Citadel should have covered their short positions in January. Why didn't they, you ask? Because they have almost bankrupted many companies like Blockbuster and Sears, but they keep the vestiges of the company in a holding pattern where shares trade for less than $1.0000 but more than $0.000001. The company that is being shorted is delisted (removed from the stock market, and becomes a pink slip ""penny stock"") but never fully bankrupted. By not bankrupting a company, the hedge fund can keep those positions open, never paying capital gain tax on the profits, but preventing any resurrections of the company. They can pump these ""Zombie stocks"" just like they pump ******n over the weekends, in order to increase collateral and meet margin calls. If they fully bankrupt a company they have to close their positions and pay tax.

The sale of a short put promises the buyer of a put that the buyer of the put can sell shares at the strike price they choose even if the stock goes below that, for a price. Say that price is $1000. That's called the premium. But for $1000, I get the right to sell (100) shares of GME at $200, EVEN IF the stock is currently being traded at $150 (This must occur before the option expires!). That means I make $50 * 100 = $5,000, minus the $1000 premium. SO for the low cost of $1000, I was able to leverage the movement of 100 shares of a stock. The hedge funds are selling these short puts, which essentially ""shows the market"" that there are 100 shares that exist somewhere, ready to be bought upon execution of the option... but they don't exist. The market is behaving as if there are billions of shares of GME ready to be bought. But there are only 76 million available, and apes aren't selling. So when that option contract expires, and the shares are no longer obfuscated in deep out of the money puts and deep in the money calls - hoo boy, it's every ape for themselves. GME and some other companies will shoot higher, and higher, as hedge funds are margin called and forced to buy back their short positions.

The shares your broker holds are ""real"" or at least as real as anyone else's in a broker. Physical shares can be used as collateral for loans at a bank, as the ownership is undisputed, but as for the 90% of shares held in brokerages... well 9 out of 10 apes are going to have to sell before the price starts going down.

Aww, you sad, stupid fool. 

&gt; Also what the fuck is ""naked speculation""? No one is buying this shit on margin.

I feel increasing pity for you. Your lack of understanding is just disturbing.

&gt; The company has $1.7 Billion in cash and 0 debt. They just restructured management into people who built Chewy and Amazon, both multi-billion dollar companies, so I think that new team knows how to grow a company.

Oh sweetheart. Look, GME operates a dead / dying business model, their only hope is to squeeze as much cash out of the business on the way down. Qualified investors read this for the bullshit it is. I've been a part of or driven dozens of strategic turnarounds and management shake ups, they can help or otherwise work in certain scenarios, but little to nothing fixes a fundamentally broken and outclassed business model. There's no management solution here, it's the wrong business in the wrong market.

And in no universe would any such - currently entirely hypothetical - strategic transformation generate the value required to justify your insane, stupid, idiotic theory. If you were trying to argue that GME was worth 2x it's valuation, you could argue it at least. You'd be wrong, but you could argue it. But you're arguing 30x+ its actual value - and you are so fucking ignorant that you don't know how hilariously absurd that is. 

Also the fact that you think ""0 debt"" is in itself a pro just further highlights your ignorance. Too much debt is bad, so is too little.

Look, just remember what I told you - ""there is no shred of evidence or logic that will ever justify a fraction of the price you're trying to convince people to buy GME and related meme stocks at. There are no qualified experts, there's no legitimate data that supports this.""

There is no universe that supports this thesis. It's actually completely ignorant idiots who eat crayons for a living who you should never listen to that comprise your ""support"". That's the truest thing they're all saying.

Give me some logic explaining for this. GME endet with Paper Certificates when  GAME went private. They are claiming the delivering come with GME symbol on it. Why do they have to write this ??

Phone them and ask them  about the background for the CA Symbol on old legit ones

I have not called different Copmutershares in different countries right now, but maybe I should  do it and ask about the Cusip NR from $ Game or other things ‚Ä¶

I would try the Phone call in UK or Canada since GameStop ist related in Canada and Game in Canada and UK. But the crime comes from America so a call in America is not the way

If you find no answers about this things, every guess about CS is financial advice..

But you stay retarded and can‚Äôt counter in legit  wayü§ü

You are a bad mod and paid for sure. By the Way ‚Ä¶$GAME is registered with Computershare too,  Retard

And the Prosoectus I was talking about is the one from 24.08.2001

Symbol GSTP.    On.  NASDQ

In History is official written that the reasons are unknown

Moderating a sub calling DEEP dive GME and never really did a own DEEp dive.

You need to Deep Dive on GameStop. I did it

Every Dive into GME will end on a part of the Fraud for beeing a secret

Over and out! And please ban me


Edit: again ‚Ä¶no one is looking the photos‚Ä¶but everyone follow blindly the CS hype ,  instead of asking questions about the mysteries around",negative

Short term they can push the price wherever they want to, but that would cost them money and dig the hole deeper. So while they still try to scare us into selling, they do it at steady rising floor and with smaller, but still sudden drops and media manipulation.

Now the problem they have is the **margin ceiling** likely coming down, thus no run up this cycle. They might try to drop it as much as possible in a last ditch effort, but the increased buy pressure by millions of individual retail investors will overwhelm them soon after. MOASS finally starts.

No investment advice, but that is why I personally am hyped for this cycle, even though Gamestop did not use the special/crypto dividend nuke option, I was hoping for. Likely they do not even have to use it, since we see currently the expected price action for the endgame. They will try to trap and shake retail out like crazy, because quarter end is coming up and they will have to use every trick to survive the liquidity and collateral strain.

Please don‚Äôt kill messenger, this is speculation. That being said, I have ordered historic options chain data and have an idea of how I could support or refute this theory with those numbers once they come in. I.e., I think I know how we could see this in data. 

I have a theory that citadel, Melvin, and the two other hedgies are wiggling their way out of this via the options market. 

Like this: in a simple options trade, there is a ‚Äòwinner and a ‚Äòloser.‚Äô If it expires ITM, the holder wins, Writer loses. If OtM, the seller wins and buyer lost. 

In the case GME, the MM (citadel) and Melvin both are guilty of fraud via fraudulent shares. They both have a vested interest in getting that off the books now that this has so much attention. That means that options contracts between them wouldn‚Äôt have the same win-lose dynamics of options contracts. They both win if contracts expire ITM with citadel on one side and hedge funds like Melvin on the other.

Here‚Äôs how: I suspect that they are writing lots of options contracts in which citadel is on one end and Melvin is on the other. All contracts that expire ITM automatically exercise. In theory, this is when naked calls would need to be bought on the market. But because they BOTH want to get this shit off the books, the contracts ‚Äúexercise‚Äù with no shares exchanged, registering on the FTDs while lowering SI. Citadel doesnt care they didn‚Äôt get the shares back - neither of them ever planned on buying them back when they naked shorted nor now. 

That is the buying pressure that in theory would catapult the price of GME. But just letting these contracts expire in the money when both parties just want the shares ‚Äúoff the books,‚Äù the FTDs that no one is raising alarm about (like...no one is complaining that they never received tens of millions of shares?) Melvin escapes bankruptcy and citadel eliminates all the shares they effectively created ‚Äúon the books‚Äù via naked shorting - not to mention that once Melvin was bankrupted, the tab would go to them. That is why they bailed Melvin out. They needed to have someone on the other side of this mutually beneficial trade, and Melvin had nothing to loose in helping citadel fix the books since the alternative was their certain bankruptcy. Citadel wanted Melvin because it didn‚Äôt want to have to approach other hedge funds to take the other side of this trade - asking them to take options contracts that expired without delivery would raise questions. Best to have someone who also has skin in the game - which is why they bailed them out. 

If true, they will clear their SI on the books in a few weeks without ever having bought a share to cover. FTDs are high but the SEC is unmanned and they will likely just get a fine. In effect, the short interest dropped but popped back up on the FTDs without creating any buying pressure.",0.9911,1,"superstonk:1:Not sure if this relates but I came across this comment from a while ago:

ha3djv9,1629759973,"I read it. The quote came from his initial interview less than a week into his job. As much as we like to think the world revolves around GME, I highly doubt that the specifics of the January events were the first thing he was briefed on upon starting the position. 

Since then, we've had confirmation that GME is working with the SEC on an investigation, and GG has taken very positive and public steps addressing exactly our issues. He's mentioned GME, he's given several very positive interviews, but he's also stayed completely silent about what is a known ongoing investigation, AS HE SHOULD. 

Look at the amount of info that this sub has discovered and generated over the last 4 months. The Vlad phone call didn't really surface until three weeks ago. 

Opinions and policies can and should change with new information. So citing this specific instance at this point in time to undermine our trust in the system seems quite suspect. 

The truth that no one who continues to harp on the government wants to admit is that the government is the only thing that is doing to allow the MOASS to exist. 

The legal contracts you have with your broker to actually give you your profits? Legal enforcement is the only way to guaranty that happens. Every contract you sign, every deal you make, ever share you've purchased, comes with the faith that when the SHFs try to get out of giving you your money, the government will force them to do so. 

Even the possibility of NFT dividend doesn't change that. What entitles you to the NFT? Ultimately, legally binding terms of service customer agreements. What's to stop everyone from just refusing to allow it to happen? If the government ultimately doesn't force the shorts to close their positions according to their legally binding contracts, they are not going to do so. 

If you don't believe that the government is going to live up to that responsibly? Then you should not be investing. Because like it or not, the law and those in charge of enforcing it are only things that is going to allow you to actuality see your profits. If you don't think they will do that, then what guaranty do you have that if you click the sell button on the way down it's going to work? The government has to ensure that. Or we're all fucked.

The quote came from his initial interview less than a week into his job. As much as we like to think the world revolves around GME, I highly doubt that the specifics of the January events were the first thing he was briefed on upon starting the position. 

Since then, we've had confirmation that GME is working with the SEC on an investigation, and GG has taken very positive and public steps addressing exactly our issues. He's mentioned GME, he's given several very positive interviews, but he's also stayed completely silent about what is a known ongoing investigation, AS HE SHOULD. 

Look at the amount of info that this sub has discovered and generated over the last 4 months. The Vlad phone call didn't really surface until three weeks ago. 

Opinions and policies can and should change with new information. So citing this specific instance at this point in time to undermine our trust in the system seems quite suspect. 

The truth that no one who continues to harp on the government wants to admit is that the government is the only thing that is doing to allow the MOASS to exist.

They don't print money and give it to rich bankers. They print it and give it to you. Allow me to go deeper.

You know your credit card? Your car loan, maybe your mortgage. definately you student loan? Where did you think that money come from? Well, you probably thought it came from the bank. Like, they took some of the money they hold in savings, and lent it out to you. You probably thought that because you believed the system was still honest.

But it isn't honest. Banks used to operate that way. They held 10 units of money, they were therefore allowed to loan out 9 units, keeping 1 unit in reserve for daily operations - Fractrional reserver banking. But now, for every 10 units of money a bank has, it can loan out 90 units of fake printed from thin air money. When a bank decides you're work the risk, they take out a loan from the Fed (who prints it from scratch) at &lt;1% interest, then hand it to you at 27% APY. They pocket your interest, but it's for YOU that the money is printed.

And what happens when you spend that loaned money? On a car, on Amazon, or you (the bank) buys a house from some dude? What happens to that money? It gets deposited in a bank. And what the fuck are they going to do with that money? It loses value everyday! Well they can loan it out again and again, but it keeps coming back, and it keeps losing value.Well, right now they are stashing it at the FED, so when the dollar crashes over night, they are protected.

\----------------

Incidentally, you might wonder if a Generation takes out 10 units of money worth of loans, and must pay back 12 units, how can they do that with only 10 units of money circulating? Interest economies REQUIRE injection of money, whether it's fiat or otherwise, so the Fed HAS to print more money to keep the economy liquid or else debt exceeds supply and the dollar is shorted the float much like how GME share 'debt' now exceeds supply and liquidity has dried up.

So the Fed prints that money, loaning it to the NEXT generation. And what do you call it when past obligations rely on future buy ins? That's right, a Ponzi scheme.",0.9437,1,"gmejungle:1:You don't understand, so I'll explain

And many have had experience and still failed. As of now this is an insanely difficult pivot to make. Maybe they can beat the odds.


&gt;Is it really getting paid a lot though if theyre taking shares at double or triple their real value that they cant sell until after the 'insane run' is over? The CEO has his compensation of 16.5M in shares at a price of ~225. If GME is only worth $50 or $75, thats real compensation of 4-5M. I imagine he made that much or more running Amazon Australia. Seems to be theyre only getting real raises if GME stock price can hold the prices they are getting paid at.

Ryan Cohen was estimated to be worth around $1 billion in 2017. He spent 76 million on GME shares before the squeeze, in late 2020, so his cost basis is hilariously low. I highly doubt he cares if he's paid 15 mil or 5 mil, his 76 million investment is probably worth 10x that even if it drops to 40 per share.




&gt;but that doesnt invalidate some of the highly compelling DD that has been posted there.




You want my ultimate ""proof"" for me that the popular theory is just all an Adderall fueled fantasy?

According to GME fans all hedge funds are greedy to no end and some hedge funds are still overshorting GME.

So why wouldn't other institutions and rival hedge funds come in and squeeze it again for a 100-1000% return in a single week? These companies are sharks and all out for themselves.

The logical answers are pretty much limited to 2 realistic options:

A.  Hedge funds and institutions actually collude endlessly at the expense of their own potential earnings (which itself goes against the theory that they are greedy and willing to win at all costs) which then means that the retail investors have zero chance of ever winning because hedge funds will always work together and win.

B. The overshorting hedge funds covered in Q1 so this opportunity for a squeeze is gone and the stock is just now a normal stock in the market but is getting a ton of social media hype like Tesla and so many others did.

h84qnpu,1628393757,"&gt;Conclusion: ...but any time it is over 50%, they are adding to the short interest for sure (which was OP's point which is also correct), mathematically there is no other way for the trades to execute since all buys and sells need to be accounted for exactly once whether they are short or not.


That is not accurate.  Firstly, let's agree that GME currently has among the highest short interest % of any large company in the country, if not the highest.  That said, have you looked at the actual Finra reported short volume data?   Not just GME, but their daily excel dumps of ALL stock short volume data?  You can download it here http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html

If what you're saying is true (that over 50% short volume MUST add short interest), then GME short volume should be among the highest of all stocks, since it has the highest short interest.  However, when you look at all stocks on Finra's daily data, you will find that it is not even close to the top.  There are usually about 2,000 stocks (out of about 10,000 listed) with higher short volume % than GME on any given day.  (I just checked, and on Friday August 6 GME short volume % was rank # 5,400 of about 9,700 tickers listed). Further, there are many stocks with EXTREMELY high short volume, and even some with 100% short volume.  Now if what you and OP is saying is true, all of those stocks should have higher short interest than GME, and we should immediately sell all our GME stock and buy into these more heavily shorted tickers because the MOASS would be even bigger.


Now, we know that's not actually the case and generally, we shouldn't think twice about any stock other than GME.  But why not? The answer is because short volume above 50% does NOT necessarily equate to or prove an increase in short interest.  When the market maker uses a short transaction to facilitate a trade (short volume), when that transaction is closed later, it is not recorded as additional 'normal' volume. Even if every trade is performed this way (leading to 100% short volume).",0.9917,1,"superstonk:1:&gt;Conclusion: ...but any time it is over 50%, they are adding to the short interest for sure (which was OP's point which is also correct), mathematically there is no other way for the trades to execute since all buys and sells need to be accounted for exactly once whether they are short or not.

h7v9pos,1628204491,"I think it‚Äôs important to remember that people who don‚Äôt go to college benefit substantially from those who do.

At this point, between the Superstonk schism, Bad Ape getting blown off for Satori, and now this dumb fuckassery with YOU, and that stupid fucking Jungle sub - I'm pretty much done. It was a nice run, it was. But I've really lost faith in these communities and the abilities of the mods to lead them.  
  
So, yes. At this point, I am a meltdowner. I still hold GME, I still preach MOASS and tell them that I love Ryan Cohen, I see things in this whole situation. Sorry, I tried being friendly over here...got nothing for it. You, dude, are the worst. I don't comprehend how Boat keeps getting unbanned in your sub lol. Has anyone even bothered to look at his history?

I'm doing so because it is a fact that no discussions can be held on there, even though I'm still ""on their side"".

I don't know if the SI could have been closed since after the crash in January. I have a feeling it could've if it was around the reported numbers. Not sure if it could've if it was much higher in reality (theories). But I have a strong feeling that the SI was **not** closed during the January squeeze.

Here's my logic:

Google Search Volume / Retail Fomo Interest was at an all time high on January 28 and only slightly less on Jan 29.

Then came the weekend. A weekend which ended on a ""**going back up**"" look on the chart.

Retail had a whole weekend to read WSB and articles, set up broker accounts and place buy orders which would then be executed on Feb 1st, the day of the crash.

My point is simple:

**1st:** I believe the bulk of retail FOMO came in on **February 1st all at once**, in form of a freaking long cue of retail fomo orders waiting to be executed. Mine was one of them. I also set up my brokerage account that same weekend. And then that same day all these orders come in GME crashes down immediately?

**2nd:** The runup was options and fomo buys, not closing positions, because it would've simply cost too much.

The general consensus during that weekend on reddit was to keep holding because of a short interest which could not be closed if everyone held. You know the story.

Also, the Robinhood trading halts came a day too early to have been responsible. The next day the chart was going up again.

Now those Barbarians are focused on that weak point and have tuned out everything else

In a strange sort of way, they must do that, because Barbarians do not have all the advantages that Rome has

There is one tribe (AMC Apes) that have found another weak spot. It is not as weak as the WEAKEST spot (GME). However, it is 510  million shares float and 1 billion to 10 billion shares sold short

Now these Barbarians are different. They think that it is not 'how weak the wall is' and it is 'how much fight the Barbarians put in'

So they are

- bringing in more Barbarians

- putting in part of their paycheck every week/every 2 weeks/every month

- fighting via Barbarian Communication Channels (Ravens and Pigeons; Hut Connect; SMoke Signal Net etc. etc.) and letting other people know

- harassing Rome and letting them know constantly they are going to go down soon

They don't understand AMC Barbarians attitude i.e. find a weak spot (2nd weakest and not as good as 1st weakest, and still a weak spot, nonetheless) and keep attacking it more and more. not care about Due Diligence and instead keep hitting that wall again and again

Rome is in a massive pickle now

They have one super weak spot (GME) which they have to defend against

Meanwhile these AMC Barbarians came from @#$#$ nowhere and created another super weak spot (AMC) just from sheer persistence and big diamond balls

at some level, both Rome and GME Barbarians, cannot believe that

h66byfi,1626989441,"Ok, you get physical (pokemon cards) or even virtual items (skins) from this. If you lose a hand in blackjack, I would argue that you gain entertainment. It is a fact that gambling is very entertaining to watch, hence viewcount. Although the average gambler is not capitalizing this value as big streamers are. You are still inherently getting some excitement/emotion from it. But is emotion a thing? I mean, my dog shits all over my rug, is a detriment to my wallet when she is sick, but I still have her around.  


If you are gambling to ""earn a living"", yes that is dangerous. But yet, there are people that day trade their savings away, and going beyond even further, there are people penny-stocking and investing into crypto which I would say is equally, if not more dangerous. And people stream and televise the stock market. We even have redditors bandwagoning and memeing GME / AMC stocks on a platform that I would say has overlapping viewership with twitch and the younger audience. I would even argue the stock market is even easier to get in than registering gambling sites. So why the outrage for gambling, but not for this?   


I also don't like the ""think of the children"" argument as well. Even if streamers can target a specific demographic, there is no absolute way a streamer can, unless it is globally implemented as a 18+ website. But then, how many young people have bypassed the 18+ to watch porn? How many people have asked someone to buy them alcohol? How many people bought an 18+ game or watched an R rated film? And how many children actually bypassed the authentication to get into these gambling sites? Why are we pushing the blame from the parents to the streamer's responsibility to take care of your children? How many times can a streamer/actor/stuntman/wrestler say don't do what I do, but still get blamed for it? How come we can't just appreciate the content and entertainment value without bringing up morality and children. If you aren't going to learn that gambling is bad, well then, maybe a kid losing their lunch money is a good wake up call. I would even argue that showing kids how dangerous gambling at an early age would be an invaluable lesson in the future. And do you think these kids have more or less money that they can potentially lose now than when they get older and gambling their mortgage away? I just don't like this children argument.

&gt;Early distributions from IRAs (that is, those made before age 59¬Ω) generally incur a 10% tax penalty, plus you may owe income tax on it, as well.

Here's the awesome thing about a Roth IRA though: Let's say you open a Roth IRA, put $6,000 into it today, and buy $GME. Wen moon, eventually sell some $GME. Then you can take *any* amount out without the 10% penalty, (because it's all same-year contributions + earnings thereof) *and* you only pay income tax on the *distributed* tendies, NOT the entirety of your gains:  


&gt;There is yet another loophole for earnings on Roth contributions, however. If you contribute and then withdraw within the same tax year, then the contribution is treated as if it were never made.  
&gt;  
&gt;For example, if you contribute $5,000 in the current year and those funds generate $500 in earnings, you can withdraw the full $5,500 penalty-free, as long as the distribution is taken prior to your tax filing due date. You would have to report those earnings as investment income, however.

E.g., Let's say you make $50k a year. You find $6k to put in the Roth IRA. Buy 35 shares of GME. MOASS happens tomorrow. You paperhand like a little ninny for an average of $100k each. Still, it's $3,500,000, so it could be a lot worse.

So you decide to quit your job, today, and pull from the Roth what you would have made from your day job through the rest of the year: $22,000. You've already been paying into income tax via payroll, probably more than you need to so you get a tax refund. But let's say you've been paying exactly enough as a single person with no dependents, no 401k, no HSA, etc. just the standard deduction, which would be about $2400 of $4300 for the year (according to [https://apps.irs.gov/app/tax-withholding-estimator](https://apps.irs.gov/app/tax-withholding-estimator))

How much do you owe the IRS for this year? $1,900   
Take another $50k out next year? No problem. Worst case, pay the 10% penalty ($5k) + $4.3k = $9.3k.

$3.5m is enough that to draw that $50k salary for more than **two full decades**, and you during that time you will not have to pay the IRS more than $210,000 **total** in at 2021 rates.  


Now. Re-run that scenario WITHOUT the Roth IRA, just buying through a normal brokerage account, selling for the same gains.

The daily volume on 6/25 was around 77M, so not a huge pct. Are the daily fail-to-deliver numbers the thing you're calling ""fake shares"" ??

h4tyxmu,1626027601,"&gt;When the buy button was shut off by brokers in January, if SHFs were covering their short positions why did the price drop rather than continuing to increase?






Because they shut off the buy button, not the sell button. So people could only sell, not buy. Causing more selling than buying, tanking the price. Shorts covering is what caused the price to rise in the first place.







&gt;If they covered in January, why did they run ads on cnbc saying citadel covered their shorts?






Wait... Why did they run ads saying they covered if they covered? Because they covered? Ask yourself, Why run ads if they didn't cover? Why report loses if you didn't cover? Why have some funds been margin called if they didn't cover? 





&gt;Why hasn't Citadel acted like a normal company since? For example, they used to post to platforms like Twitter regularly and they are now working through the night 7 days a week.





1&amp;2.  Maybe because a cult has targeted them? Stalking them? Threatening them if they don't give up the tendies? 





3.the economy is opening back up and in serious trouble. The market is unstable, entirely unrelated yo GME, its been heading towards this since the micro-crash in march 2020. Other funds are also working more. Regular everyday companies are also working more. Are they short GME too? 





&gt;Why did we run up in price afterward from $40 to nearly $350 over a couple of days when everyone thought this was already over?






Because of pump and dump. If you notice, theres a wave like pattern. Of people buying in, and selling off at highs. The peaks get lower and lower because they can't create enough pump hype, so it doesn't get as high. If funds can crash the price at any number, why let it get to 300 at all? And if they can't drop it at low prices to keep it low, how can they do it at higher prices? 





&gt;Why did we run-up from 240 to 340 then back down to 170 on no news on March 10th all before 1pm






I believe this was a gamma squeeze caused by options, up to 340 and then stockholders selling at 340 to cash in on tendies. I was actually in for this one and sold some at 330, nearly tripling my investment. 






&gt;Why has the price swung over $30 up then back down on no news within 5 minutes time?






NVDA dropped almost 90$ in one day, no news, no fundamentals, nada. Most of the market bled the same day. Was that hedgies too? It bounced right back. Stocks do this. I get you're new, but its not all that odd. At 200, a drop of 30 is like a 6% drop or less, not much lol. 







I'm sure you can come come up with more ""coincidences"" and never once realize how stupid you sound to actual investors. And this idiocy is spreading to other stocks. Everything is suddenly a conspiracy. Sure, wall st is fucking greedy and shady. Duh? Every investor knows this. We know this lol. But who the fuck isn't? You think RC isn't counting his money? Think he doesn't want more? Then why does he have any? He's the same shit stain, just in a different suit.

Archegos dealt with CFDs because they do not require normal disclosures and they could over leverage without the public knowing. CFDs do not impact prices because they aren't shares at all, and banks/prime brokers that sell them normally get greedy and don't buy the underlying asset on which the contract is based on. The rest of Hwang's portfolio were longs that were sold off to cover losses that we know of, could be more to come.

h4gj7wq,1625740445,"This actually wont work right now for NEGG because it popped more than any other stock I've seen get pumped by WSB. As of this morning the options chain hasn't been built out past $40 and the borrow cost on shorting the stock is at ludicrous levels of &gt;80% annual interest rate. 

But in general you would:   
Step 1) Short the stock when you think its near the peak. Obviously this is hard to time but if you're in the 2-3x the actual value of the company chances are its been pumped. Also since you're using a collar you can ride things out if it keeps mooning. 

Step 2) Immediately sell a put options around the price you think it will drop to for exactly the same number of shares you shorted divided by 100 for the options contract size. But give yourself some decent buffer on the strike price because some of these overpriced stocks take a while to drop back to reasonable valuations. For this stock it popped from $10 to $70 in a two weeks, maybe assume that it drops halfway back to around $35 and sell you put here. You'll want to also time the expiration on the put to be 2-3 months out to give time for the stock to mean revert... reddit is notoriously myopic in their investing timeline and 2-3 months seems to do the trick.

Step 3) buy an OTM call for exactly the same premium as the put you sold at the same expiration. The proceeds from the put cover the cost of your call and you're hedged for zero cost.  

If the strategy works and the stock trades down below the put your sold the put will expire in the money and close out your short position, and the call will expire worthless. 

WARNING! This strategy does have risks. The main one being that not every stock that moons returns to its intrinsic value, AMC and GME have been trading in la la land for months now. But for the vast majority of stocks that WSB pumps have retracted to roughly their target valuations. Also don't size the position greater than the maximum loss your account can handle. Know your excess liquidity on your margin account and size the OTM call so that if the stock does continue to trade up you can safely ride out the storm without being forced to cover.

There is clear evidence of ""naked shorting"" in the options chain. I don't know how familiar you are with options, but *someone* has been using options trickery to reset reg sho close-out. This is the obligation they have to deliver a stock they sold - they are not delivering the stock, they are just resetting the timer.

The SEC discusses and warns about the technique here: [https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf)

There really isn't a more plausible explanation for the options data. These Deep ITM contracts sometimes only exist for seconds or minutes before they are duplicated and flipped, incurring massive costs when it would have been cheaper to just buy shares. There's no reasonable options strategy to explain the data - it's the clearest (and biggest) example of reset transactions I have ever seen.

[This author does a good job of reviewing some of the data](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvdgf5/the_naked_shorting_scam_in_numbers_ai_detection/), but I would ignore the parts about ""AI Detection"" and the number of ""hidden shorts"". But the data is real and verifiable. A market maker would have to be involved in this transaction, and we know that Citadel is the designated market maker for the NYSE, and we know they write their options on the PHLX exchange. If I can speculate, I suspect that the Market Maker (Citadel) ""sold short"" during the January run-up (and since).

That might sound unrealistic, but read this quote from a [congress research paper](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RS22099.htm):

&gt;Under certain circumstances, **a market maker may engage in naked short selling to stabilize the market**. For example, assume that there is a **sudden flurry of buy orders** for a stock. The market maker may judge the buying interest to be temporary and not justified by any real news about the company's prospects. It may be the result of a questionable press release or a rumor in an **Internet chat room**. The market maker may choose to sell short to avoid what in its view would be an unjustified run-up in the stock's price.

It is normal for Market Makers to naked short (they do it every day to provide liquidity), and I think we can all agree that the run-up GME saw in January was a result of manipulation and not justified by the company's prospects. It seems reasonable to me that the market maker would have sold short in an attempt to stabilise the stock. 

So Citadel may have sold short, and instead of locating and delivering the share to buyers, they have been resetting reg sho close-out with options ever since. This is common and considered a trick-of-the-trade. No conspiracy needed.

So while you may be correct that it was mainly hedge funds that profited from this scam, someone still appears to be holding a very large underwater short position. It doesn't appear to be over yet, and you may see that this stock has room to grow as Citadel slowly unwind their position - which is probably why the stock has continued to rise from $40 to $200+ after the initial big crash in January.",0.8477,-1,"qult_headquarters:-1:You have some interesting views that I agree with, but there are some nuances that you may not be aware of.

It just so happens that the current reverse repo rate is hovering around 0%, so they don't want any interest for their cash, as long as the feds park the Treasury bonds with them for them to rehypothecate.

The Chapter 11 proceedings will allow Greylock to restructure its debt and terminate its Madison Avenue office lease in Manhattan, according to a Jan. 31 filing signed by Chief Financial Officer David Steltzer.

**Reddit Trading Crowd Ran Over Wall Street Hedge Funds**

It‚Äôs really disparaging to see how Wall Street‚Äôs analysts have underestimated these guys on wallstreetbets. They really implied that this Reddit crowd can‚Äôt do the same quality of research as an analyst in a hedge fund.

Reddit‚Äôs army have kept motivating each other to keep piling into shares and derivatives (i.e. long call options) and coordinated a short squeeze of a lifetime in GameStop. They are making history now and we are just starting to see the impact of that event. I strongly predict that we will see lots of bankruptcy in the coming days.

Why GameStop has caused so much pain? At the top of the pecking order was Mervin Capital, who is historically really good btw. But what happens is that its trades are really often copied by other hedge funds. Is that great due diligence for you? That resulted in 136% short interest caused by many hedge funds that mimicked Mervin Capital. End result? They are going to file for bankruptcy sooner rather than later.

GameStop event could cause a market crash

My biggest worry right now is how this buying frenzy in GameStop could potentially raise so much concern in the market and thus undermine the overall confidence of investors.

This short squeeze is definitely a big deal and this will make history not because of the company that is GameStop but because this phenomenon will expose to everyone in the world how dangerous short-selling can be and how hedge fund strategies are really not that genius as everyone could think of.",0.9741,3,"amcstock:3:I have no alerts but I know the price is to low until you see the headlines like this for Shitadel and others. HUGE shout out to ALL the APES of GME &amp; AMC and others that are fucking up the hedgies! **WE ARE WINNING! HODL APE! HODL! AND PLEASE SHARE TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS.**

My question is still the same, why is this good news? 

Russell 2000 sell-off is highly likely to be bigger than Russell 1000 buy-in. Why? Because GME is a relatively large player in 2000, but will be peanuts compared to companies like MSFT in the 1000. This means funds don't HAVE to buy-in to GME to stay close to tracking the 1000. Especially given high volatility of the stock. No shorts have to cover to exit from 2000, no shorts have to cover to buy into 1000. 

Where are we expecting the buying pressure to come from? The same sad fucks shouting ""don't expect 002 to have direct impact"" - I've seen 0 posts stating 002 should have a direct impact, are pushing the 1000 narrative without any valid reasons why this is a good thing.

h2p3kjz,1624396682,"Because taxing unrealized gains would be terrible. An unrealized gain is by definition something you don't actually have, just a potential earning if you sold the assets today. The problem is until you realize that gain you dont actually have anything. 

So first just from a tax perspective, one you you own let's say a GME stock that went up 200%. You have not sold that stock but then the government comes and tells you to pay taxes on it. You can be forced to sell the stock, which is not great for many reason we can discuss later, or you can try to pay the taxes on it with other income. 

Then the day after you pay taxes the stock goes down but you have to sell it for other reasons. You never got the gain in the stock but you had to pay taxes on it. Its possible with a ton of rules and rebate  systems there could be some system that does an ok job but at the end it would cause a ton of issues for anyone buying stock. 

Also you need to think that forcing someone to sell an asset to pay for that asset is really bad since the assets could have other value beyond its price. For stocks, they give you ownership in a company. For normal investors this is not important  but for an owner of a company its vital. Let's take home ownership as another example of why forcing realization on an asset makes no sense. If your house value doubles in price and the government requires you pay taxes on it, but you dont have the money to pay it. Then you would have to sell your house to pay for the taxes on the house. These types of negative incentives are what you want to avoid. 


The truth is, if the government ever tried to create a taxes on unrealized gains it would create a massive negative incentive to ever buy or hold those assets. It would cause a very large change in the overall fabric of the financial system.

h2p1eg8,1624395644,"Lol GME is not some fundamental property of economics, and a new way that the working class gets to finally have money. It is a random malfunction of their gambling system. Its great for the workers, like a gold mine randomly exploded and showered everyone with a little bit of gold, on average, including also a bunch of rocks that broke stuff.

What do you think is going to happen with this GME stock? It just keeps going up forever and can finally provide an income for the working class, in spite of the wishes of the evil socialist billionaires? Come on you cant think that.

The fundamentals certainly do not support $400 a share are you being serious? You think all the analysts were off by several hundred percent? Unlike any other stock analysis in the history of capitalism? I guess if you include the new ""meme vandalism investor class"" as a new part of ""the fundamentals"" but I think thats pretty much the opposite of the word ""fundamental."" 

Things like P/E ratio or how many video games they sell for example, put the price below $100. Maybe it has gone up since then if they made a little money selling their weirdly inflated stock and reinvested it somehow.... but this is a weird fluke in the system and is not a new method of living in capitalism or how the economy fundamentally works now. 

Its just some weird thing that happened. IF the working class has a net gain in money, it will ONLY be because some billionaires gambled the wrong way. All they have to do is not gamble like that again, and they will not be with this particular GME stock (probably a good thing, short sellers and the stock market in general are often harmful). 

Money is not being created from nothing an given to GME apes, and I guarantee you that there are no new billionaires investing in GME shorts, they must consider it extremely dangerous. New money that appears in the GME trading world is coming from your fellow apes trying to join in too late.

As far as technical analysis goes there's only so much to say. The last 3 months or so the stock has behaved fairly standard, if not a bit exaggerated in its price action.

As far as fundamental analysis what else is there to even speculate at this point? They've secured the talent, their numbers were good at earnings. Now we just have to wait and see if their supposed transformation is as game changing as everyone speculated it could be. 

Any DD you see about there being a potential MOASS in the future is just gaslighting at this point to keep as many people from selling as possible.

&gt;I think for many people--including myself--it is the odd behavior with the stock that really fuels the investors

I actually don't think it's that odd. It's definitely the biggest in scale, the worthiest competitor would be maybe tesla in 2019 and 2020. But even then you've got AMC, BB, pltr late last year, and pretty much every meme crypto like dogecoin and safemoon for example behaving similarly and that's just off the top of my head, there are many other examples.

&gt;the 140% short position taken on the stock

This was true pre January but everything now suggests a much lower SI, I believe around 20% but I'm not up to date. SS obviously disagrees but by every metric it seems to show that so you need a heavily biased conspiracy theoryesque narrative (in my opinion) to explain all that away, like I was referring to in my last comment. There's a good analysis of it on gme meltdown DD sub if you're interested.

&gt;Why not just cover their position and be done? 

There isn't really a reason to do that unless they're in danger of a margin call. Borrow fees are so low so it doesn't cost much to maintain the position, and the sizes of their positions is what's important for the former which is something that we can't really know. Also keep in mind the SS narrative is that they are bleeding money on (low) fees, but remember these companies are hugely profitable and are also making consistent income from other places.
 Imagine you had an entry level very modest 5k account and you shorted 1 stock of gme at the current price- you wouldn't be margin called or 'squeezed' until gme hit 5k because that's the price your broker would make you buy it back, in knowing that if it went any higher you wouldn't be able to pay.
That's a bit of an oversimplification but as you can see with 5k capital at your back you can protect yourself from that purely by managing your position sizing. It would have to go up around 20x for it to be an issue. However, when DFV went long it was around $4 and as we know in January it hit over 400, so that was a 100x increase which would have totally blown shorts out of the water- no way of knowing if they did actually cover but again from all the reporting and lowered SI it seems like they did. I also watched it in real time and there were 25mil vol spikes in premarket which I have to assume was industry, and that lines up perfectly with for example Melvins reported losses- they even told us they covered around the time that happened. Not to mention the volume around that time was way way higher than the outstanding short positions.

Now for a 5k account I wouldn't reccomend that trade, it might take you a year (I mean look at tesla, burry is only just now shorting it) to make $100 and you probably want to be doing more high risk reward stuff with a small account, but for industry that trade makes sense.

&gt;Robinhood cutting off trading to meet margin requirements despite the DTCC waiving it

I don't really know enough about this to comment on it so I'm gonna let someone else take this one.

What I will reiterate is that it's not abnormal behaviour in my opinion, this kind of thing happens all the time albeit usually not to this scale, the last example that I took part in was pltr towards the end of last year when it became a wsb meme. The thing is, even now the stock is still up over 50x more from a year ago, and as the price increases those % increases get harder to come by. If you think it didn't squeeze then with an over 100% SI then what kind of % gains would you need to squeeze it now with a 20% SI?

To summarise I'm completely convinced at this point this is just a huge scale meme/hype stock and I want to learn how the psychology behind it works because I don't want to not have calls on the next tesla or gme when it happens. Had calls on pltr when it went from $16 to $40 and that was sweet. I think the SS DD is mostly manipulative rubbish and I think a bunch of people here know what they're talking about, plenty of people here are long gme and swing trade it but the difference between them and SS is they will take profits (the last obvious one being when the vote count didn't exceed the shares, we all knew this would happen so the obvious trade was to buy in the hype and sell when the results came out which I didn't do but I think a lot here did).

h16pjju,1623264330,"Just a couple of thoughts from the top of my head (I'm long GME):

\- Brand recognition: if you are going to enter the eCommerce game, provide a new service or disrupt an existing one, one of the biggest hurdles you'll face is getting your brand name recognized. Becoming a household name takes time, but GameStop has that in the bag already. Big time. If I had more venture capital, I'd be going in balls deep.

\- Existing customer base. PowerUp Rewards members - quite a few of those.

\- Physical console sales aren't going away any time soon, and a lot of people will still buy physical discs for a long time, until Internet speeds catch up. If you live in the rural parts of America, for example, downloading games is not as easy as it sounds. Digital game market needs a specific incentive to buy from a middle man, but I see GS taking steps into certain directions that make me feel confident I have a good idea what they're planning (Not sharing, but very bullish: has to do with the digital game market specifically, allowing them to incentivize most gamers everywhere to use their platform).

\- eSports and experience-driven locations. If you've ever attended a LAN party, you know the appeal. GameStop is already moving into this direction with select stores and more to follow.

\- Ryan Cohen. Yes, it doesn't say much, but if you know the man and what he has done, it speaks volumes. Also, you don't buy nine million shares of an extremely heavily shorted company without having a plan to dislodge those shorts - something's in the works.

\- New GameStop board members from Amazon, Google, Chewy etc. All accepted to be paid in GME stock. Quite frankly, I believe that the job offer from RC came with a non-disclosure agreement, and if people signed up (when the base stock price was around $180), there's something on the table that only RC and the board knows.

\- Gamer culture: if you're a gamer, you know GameStop, especially now with the worldwide attention. Gamers are their own kind of breed, and a lot of gamers, old and new, are currently in the demographic that have stable income.

\- Gaming and its market cap - video games have grown into an *insanely huge* industry whose importance only keeps growing, far surpassing books, music and movies. When the business fully transitions from the brick &amp; mortar retailer to an eCommerce model, their market cap will have to be re-evaluated. It's going to be... different. I fully expect to see GME growing into something that far surpasses even these 'meme' prices.

\- Publicity: you can't get advertisements  better than this. The Reddit crowd 'rally' news went viral worldwide, and GME will forever be the brand associated with the little underdog duking it out with the Wall Street.

\- Debt-free company. After a few good earnings reports (which will be forthcoming due to the rabid and dedicated customer base), expect to see GME in different indices far above its current status.

And there's a lot of stuff where that came from. I have ideas where they could go, and what they could do already within a short-ish time frame. The 'meme' stock status is just a narrative if you look at the fundamentals and understand gamer culture and what type of business prospects they can muster. Couple that with new leadership, a dream-team of heavy hitters with a proven track record and I'm bullish long-term. I saw GME as a good long-term value investment (am an old gamer myself) where you could hop in on the ground floor while the price was artificially suppressed via shorting.

Finally, I don't care too much about the impending short squeeze when it comes to my *long-term* investing decisions, but I can't rule that out either. Looking at the media and the bashing GME gets, coupled with the skepticism drummed up by just about every other media outlet out there taking a paycheck from some other source than the government, it doesn't take a big brain to see they're going against the heckles of someone with big money. All the firewall rules getting passed by the DTCC tells me that Big Money players are expecting something big to happen, like maybe a few larger intermediaries getting liquidated due to large short positions. No matter what happens or when, judging by the looks of what's going on in the background behind all the artificial noise, it's going to be big. Lifetime customer base with good capital reserves guaranteed.

But yeah, I'm a gamer and I like good value when I see it. I don't mind jumping onto 'unconventional' choices and I often go against the grain here and there when I believe I have insight into things that others simply don't. I'm looking at a 3-5 year investment period, and I fully expect the (stable) share price - based on the fundamentals alone - to be closer to $1200 to $2000 in around 5 years.

And I can agree to disagree with anyone here. No need to argue. I just like the stock. :) If you don't see GME as a value play, it's understandable - it's just not for you.",0.9978,134,"investing:134:Just a couple of thoughts from the top of my head (I'm long GME):

\- Brand recognition: if you are going to enter the eCommerce game, provide a new service or disrupt an existing one, one of the biggest hurdles you'll face is getting your brand name recognized. Becoming a household name takes time, but GameStop has that in the bag already. Big time. If I had more venture capital, I'd be going in balls deep.

\- Existing customer base. PowerUp Rewards members - quite a few of those.

\- Physical console sales aren't going away any time soon, and a lot of people will still buy physical discs for a long time, until Internet speeds catch up. If you live in the rural parts of America, for example, downloading games is not as easy as it sounds. Digital game market needs a specific incentive to buy from a middle man, but I see GS taking steps into certain directions that make me feel confident I have a good idea what they're planning (Not sharing, but very bullish: has to do with the digital game market specifically, allowing them to incentivize most gamers everywhere to use their platform).

\- eSports and experience-driven locations. If you've ever attended a LAN party, you know the appeal. GameStop is already moving into this direction with select stores and more to follow.

\- Ryan Cohen. Yes, it doesn't say much, but if you know the man and what he has done, it speaks volumes. Also, you don't buy nine million shares of an extremely heavily shorted company without having a plan to dislodge those shorts - something's in the works.

\- New GameStop board members from Amazon, Google, Chewy etc. All accepted to be paid in GME stock. Quite frankly, I believe that the job offer from RC came with a non-disclosure agreement, and if people signed up (when the base stock price was around $180), there's something on the table that only RC and the board knows.

\- Gamer culture: if you're a gamer, you know GameStop, especially now with the worldwide attention. Gamers are their own kind of breed, and a lot of gamers, old and new, are currently in the demographic that have stable income.

\- Gaming and its market cap - video games have grown into an *insanely huge* industry whose importance only keeps growing, far surpassing books, music and movies. When the business fully transitions from the brick &amp; mortar retailer to an eCommerce model, their market cap will have to be re-evaluated. It's going to be... different. I fully expect to see GME growing into something that far surpasses even these 'meme' prices.

\- Publicity: you can't get advertisements  better than this. The Reddit crowd 'rally' news went viral worldwide, and GME will forever be the brand associated with the little underdog duking it out with the Wall Street.

h0yiaf1,1623101491,"Below is the original email. So our friend Eric didn‚Äôt answer my question in its entirety. It‚Äôs still unknown if a vote count tally will be announced within 4 biz days, but at least we got some partial confirmation bias ;)

‚ÄúGreetings GameStop IR team!
 
As a new shareholder in GME I'm looking forward to the upcoming Annual Meeting of Stockholders. GME's transformation has provided a very compelling reason to believe in the future of the company again, and I'm excited to see what other new initiatives are presented at this year's meeting. At the same time, I join the many millions of other retail investors who have expressed concern over the recent short selling phenomenon, and was hoping to get clarity on the voting process as it pertains to a total vote count.
 
From my understanding, holders of record of shares of common stock as of the close of business on April 15, 2021 are entitled to notice of and to vote at the annual meeting. Shares of common stock can be voted only if the stockholder is present or is represented by proxy at the annual meeting. As of the record date, 70,771,778 shares of common stock were issued, outstanding and entitled to vote.
 
I have already voted through my broker, Charles Schwab. Countless others have done the same. So, my simple question is this: At what point is the Final Vote Count Tally made public? Does this occur prior to, during, or subsequent to the AMS? And on the same train of thought, what are the implications of a final vote count tally that vastly exceeds the 70,771,778 shares of common stock on record at close of business April 15th?
 
Any insight into the above would help alleviate some of my concerns heading into this important event.

h0xqtdl,1623089752,"That's completely fair and yeah my edits tend to be an added stream of consciousness without taking into account the structure that preceded it unfortunately. I can try my best to be honest about what this is. Having read so much of the DD and realizing the gargantuan amounts of immoral, evil fraud we're going up against, it makes it easy as a leftist to already think ""yeah yeah I know this stuff already"" and keep my eyes on the win so I can try to help people going forward.

It really does sound unrealistic and entirely unfathomable, but the world has genuinely never seen a perfect storm brewing like this to compare it to. 

I never thought about those who lost and didn't make it back in the game. It's easy to get caught up in the reddit frenzy and be surrounded by those who diamond handed and bought more, when the reality is that there were people who got dragged in once and never wanted to be involved again.

It's possibly crass and short sighted but I think of it as ""ok some of you lost money before this point, but it's a potentially insignificant amount of you considering the money that *will* come through soon."" As someone that invests frequently, it's hard to feel for every person that loses, just because it's constant and feels like it's in the background.

The nature of WSB and shady/gamified nature of apps like RH (who sell your data to Citadel so you likely lose either way eventually) is going to cause some people to lose money, no matter how many disclaimers there are. This is true. The subreddit changed drastically when they began to shoot down GME posts in favor of other pump and dumps and the community skyrocketed past 10m users. (Hedge funds actually directly benefit from WSB pumping certain stocks which helps them avoid being margin called for their billions in GME losses)

In the superstonk subreddit there are still those that vehemently refuse to use this situation as a course change for something positive because their biases are still deep rooted. Yes, they talk like leftists, they act like leftists, but when they so much as sense a word ending in 'ism' is about to be said, they will fling shit at the walls and try to find any slim justification for capitalism and ""both sides"" they can. The propaganda runs deep, even to people who can correctly point out CNBC propaganda in the same breath.

They know people have been wronged, hell, there was a thread today in which they were remembering their loved ones lost to cancer because of the rampant naked short selling that bankrupted BioTech research companies in the 80s.

It's going to be a hard sell convincing an ape about the average joes that lost during all of this, especially when and if the price skyrockets and pulls those people out of the red. In that subreddit you're only surrounded with people that use their share price of 300, 400+ as a badge of honor and that they'll be ""picked up"" soon. 

The highest possible price you could be shackled to is 483 something a share, and that will seem small in the near future. 

There are those that unfortunately had to sell for a loss to save the remaining money they had, when if they had held they'd have made up some of those losses. Being able to do that in itself, and ""buying the dip"" is inherently favoring people with more funds.

This was a good discussion though and I will have to re-read everything to make sure I fully digest what you wrote",0.6091,5,"latestagecapitalism:5:That's completely fair and yeah my edits tend to be an added stream of consciousness without taking into account the structure that preceded it unfortunately. I can try my best to be honest about what this is. Having read so much of the DD and realizing the gargantuan amounts of immoral, evil fraud we're going up against, it makes it easy as a leftist to already think ""yeah yeah I know this stuff already"" and keep my eyes on the win so I can try to help people going forward.

It really does sound unrealistic and entirely unfathomable, but the world has genuinely never seen a perfect storm brewing like this to compare it to. 

I never thought about those who lost and didn't make it back in the game. It's easy to get caught up in the reddit frenzy and be surrounded by those who diamond handed and bought more, when the reality is that there were people who got dragged in once and never wanted to be involved again.

It's possibly crass and short sighted but I think of it as ""ok some of you lost money before this point, but it's a potentially insignificant amount of you considering the money that *will* come through soon."" As someone that invests frequently, it's hard to feel for every person that loses, just because it's constant and feels like it's in the background.

The nature of WSB and shady/gamified nature of apps like RH (who sell your data to Citadel so you likely lose either way eventually) is going to cause some people to lose money, no matter how many disclaimers there are. This is true. The subreddit changed drastically when they began to shoot down GME posts in favor of other pump and dumps and the community skyrocketed past 10m users. (Hedge funds actually directly benefit from WSB pumping certain stocks which helps them avoid being margin called for their billions in GME losses)

In the superstonk subreddit there are still those that vehemently refuse to use this situation as a course change for something positive because their biases are still deep rooted. Yes, they talk like leftists, they act like leftists, but when they so much as sense a word ending in 'ism' is about to be said, they will fling shit at the walls and try to find any slim justification for capitalism and ""both sides"" they can. The propaganda runs deep, even to people who can correctly point out CNBC propaganda in the same breath.

They know people have been wronged, hell, there was a thread today in which they were remembering their loved ones lost to cancer because of the rampant naked short selling that bankrupted BioTech research companies in the 80s.

It's going to be a hard sell convincing an ape about the average joes that lost during all of this, especially when and if the price skyrockets and pulls those people out of the red.

It's valued at 17B while the company has been losing roughly around 500M annually. It's possible they right the ship, it's possible they don't. At the current value, that risk is definitely not priced in. 

A good example to compare to is BBY. Bestbuy is also selling tech but definitely not as specialized. They have a revenue of 44B (to GME's 6.5B), profits of 1.5B (GME -470M) and much more of an online presence already.

h0qr0zu,1622938333,"The key points on why GameStop isn't failing.

1. Ryan Cohen is the ex-CEO of Chewy (he cashed out for billions) and recently became the largest shareholders of GME.

2. The former CFO of GameStop has ties to the short hedge funds, has bankrupted two companies prior and rumor is he was going to tank the company as well to make the shorts a ton of money.

3. Cohen used his influence to oust the CFO and the CEO and began to fill top executive spots with colleagues from Chewy and Amazon in order to transform GameStop from just brick and mortar to e-commerce.

4. From something like Feb to May, Cohen had begun issuing 3.5 million shares onto the market. This was when hedge funds were heavily counterfeiting stock so it went largely unnoticed and didn't affect the price at all. However, this allowed GameStop to raise $550 million and allowed them to pay off all debts they held two years early.

5. This paying off debt allowed them to  pivot on things like remodeling stores, building new stores, access to loans and the like. This puts them in a very strong position to implement the transformation Cohen wants.

6. GameStop also just announced an NFT system (think like crypto but attached to specific digital items). This means that you will be able in the future to trade in digital games for cash and GameStop can resell the digital copy.

h0osm12,1622902835,"As a holder of both I'll try to give my best perspective as to why it may feel this way.

I've read all of the dd on both amc and gme. Countless hours of combing through reddit and following a rabbit hole of links. I've made considerable money on amc and I'm happy it's popping off. I think amc has a ways to go up no doubt with no current ceiling.

I also still believe gme is the main play. The amount of variables that go into this are endless and I could go on and on about why I believe this to be the case, but my understanding of the situation doesn't translate well into my ability to convey it clearly. I'm simply too smooth brained.

I'm more then aware that I could be wrong. I'm far from a genius. This is why I own both. Here are my main reasons for believing gme is the main play....

&amp;#x200B;

1.Far less of a free float in shares = less diamond hands needed for a massive boom.

2.Micheal burry( big short) has proven time and again that he believes gme is the play

3. Company fundamentals favor gme to be potentially undervalued currently. The same can not be said for amc.(easier to hodl)

4.Significantly more fud has been thrown my way regarding gme then amc. Not to say amc hasn't had its fair share.

5. 2 sub migrations as a result of mods fuckery for gme

6. the negative beta on gme

&amp;#x200B;

I could go on and on, but these are my main reasons off of the top of my head. I've had a theory for some time now that amc was being used as a distraction from the moass(there can only be one moass). I've also theorized that so many apes flocked to the distraction that the hedgies fucked up and got themselves into another pickle in amc. I think amc will pop and pop big. I also think there is only 1 gme. 

I guess my point is... Someone who is all in on gme and believes as I do could understandably be frustrated in thinking that fellow apes are being manipulated away from their true purpose. I believe we would have already won by now as an ape community had we just stayed with gme from the start.

GME is being short squeezed, and still is. If you do not understand the dynamics of a short squeeze and option strategies then you really are uninformed on GME. 

Hedge funds thought they could bankrupt GME by shorting it. Retailers said nah, and bought in. Due to hedge funds being so disgustingly greedy, to short Gamestop despite it being at $4, they got absolutely wrecked when GME went from $4 -&gt; $480. Their short positions were so large and many still have not covered (as it would be incredibly expensive), and now we have this game where shorts are trying to cover while suppressing price, which usually means shorting the stock more. 

Well that's my simple take it. The actual market dynamics at play here are very complex.

Edit: a merger or reverse merger or crypto dividend will all yield the same result: the call back of shares; merger will create new cuisp which will require a call back of shares causing squeeze; a crypto dividend will require all shares back before tokens minting and ensure it‚Äôs accounted for therefore causing shorts to squeeze .. they all do the same purpose just a diff method. But a crypto dividend won‚Äôt happen until the entire market changes. In the near future sure. Realistically and short term? No",positive

Alright it's actually super simple. It's supply and demand, at the end of the day. These hedgefunds? The contracts they opened allow the risk to be infinite. As in, a stock they are shorting can only go to zero. But a stock can rise and rise and rise into infinity. These hedgefunds NEED your shares. They don't want them, they NEED them. Our shares are the only shares on the world they can use. Our shares are the only shares in the world that they MUST buy. They MUST cover their shorts positions in the end. If everybody except you and me sold shares, and we had the absolute last 100k shares? We set the price. It goes for the larger scale. We. Set. The. Price. They need those 100k shares. They will do anything for these shares. They want to pay us 1000 dollars. We say no. They must buy them still. They say 10k, we say no. 50k? 100k? No. We said 500k, we will get 500k. They need our shares to cover. Rinse and repeat until we reach a number so high that it doesn't hurt our brains, but it hurts the hedgefunds brains. Again, their risks are infinite. They agreed to the loss equal to infinity if the stock were to rise.

So, the hedgefunds have assets. When they get margin called, they will have ALL OF THEIR ASSETS LIQUIDATED TO COVER their short positions. There are multiple hedgefunds that are shorting AMC, so we can take their money from liquidation too. I don't know the number but obviously billions and billions. After the hedgefunds money runs out, there's a 50t-70t dollar reinnsurance that pays out to us. I didn't want to say this but I feel like leaving it out is kind of shilly and manipulative, I have no idea where the money comes from if it reaches that point. Maybe the government steps in and prints money? You have to remember it's not just AMC that's gonna squeeze. The GME/AMC squeezes will be the absolute largest transfer of wealth in the history of the world. And probably the largest transfer of wealth in the future of the world is. That's a big if, but I believe it.

From what I hear, ultimately the hedgefunds aren't in control after the margin call. I believe a clearing house goes through and buys all the shares. It's most likely done by a computer. set alerts in your app for the prices. If you set them correctly your phone will blow the fuck up when the squeeze happens. Do your own DD on setting sell limits and all that. I dont know enough to speak about that. Also, the floor is 500k and we sell at 500k on the way down. And that means that we hold and hold and hold. Through 1k all the way to the floor price. Once we the floor price? Right now that's our floor. That's when we sell. But only sell on the way down, the opposite side. This prevents it from making the floor lower (from giving the clearing house CHEAP CHEAP shares for the hedgefunds. We don't want that. Make them bleed). If we continue to hold and the share price increases through the 500k floor? The floor isn't 500k, it's 1m. 

I don't like doing dates but we're in the actual end game. Whatever is going to happen, is starting to happen. That doesn't necessarily mean it's squeezing, but the snowball is rolling down the hill gaining mass and momentum from the other snow. Eventually it's gonna hit something. And it's starting to break apart and create more of those snowballs that will roll down with incredible momentum. Be ready, be mentally prepared. What we are about to see very soon is something most of us have never seen and will only see in these moments. Control your emotions when you see numbers that blow your head off. Be smart when you see your life changing amounts of money. It'll fluctuate thousands at a time, don't be scared. You aren't the only one. And we have your back. 

Also we are gonna pay capital gains tax equal to billions and billions, maybe trillions (up to 25t+ for USA apes). Obviously I don't know the number. But our taxes we pay will (in my ape opinion) come BACK to us in the end if the feds need to step in. If we pay billions into the feds and they give it back to cash us out? Kind of a closed system. It helps prevent MORE inflation. But wait, what about the money after taxes? YOU MEAN THE MONEY THAT WILL STIMULATE THE ECONOMY? In a way nobody has thought of? A hundred THOUSAND new MILLIONAIRES??? we created a new class. The class of amc. The class of apes. The class of MOASS 

If the hedgefunds escape? The world loses faith in the united states stock market. They will pull out their money. Causing the dollar to crash and another currency to take over. USA will not let that happen. They'll print and print and print before that happens

Our shares may be ""synthetic"", but in terms of legitimacy, our shares are real. As in, we can buy with them, trade them. They are documented and there is proof that you and I BOUGHT these shares.

1st. Previously AA propose to dilute the shares, and he asks people to vote yes for it. However, AA decide to stop that because he listen to retail investors. And then he had meeting AMA with trey, youtube streamer. He said he like king kong more than godzilla. So people think AA is against hedgies.

But you got me there when you said AA prepare to dilute the shares so shorter can cover their ass. Im too smooth brain to decide which side is truth. Can you give me more info? 

3rd. Shitadale buy into amc news  got cover on amc sub, they said shitadel prepare to sell those and create a fake squeeze later on.  Is it possible?

4th, currently amc having a strong momentum, there is a person who spend money for billboard in vegas, airplane w sign flying around LA, chicago etc...

At the end of this, im struggling whether to sell or hodl.  Reason is AA isnt as good as RC like you said. AA didnt do anything to improve the business model of amc, while RC making miracle. The only reason im hodling is because im betting gme will trigger the Moass first and cause domino fall affect on hedgies, which in return help amc squeeze successfully.

I think right now you can't short any crypto because the market is volatile and shorting is more dangerous, so what they want probably is to  monitor it so people won't lose money with shorting, so etoro doesn't have a lot of lost money since I think keeping a short position over might costs you or something or they close it after a day and the crypto market is always open, so with crypto jumping even while people are probably sleeping could result in a lot money that would be lost which they probably wouldn't get back because the people don't have the ability to give the money back and that would result in a very sad and broke eToro.

If ALL shorts cover (7% IS THE SHORT FLOAT), the price won‚Äôt go up to 3$...it‚Äôs roughly 66.5million shares, out of almost ONE BILLION outstanding shares, I clocked it at 950million doing the general math. 

If they all return their shares, the price probably will end up around 1.50 ... and keep in mind shorts don‚Äôt just return shares for fun, ZOM needs to give them a reason... they are not over leveraged here like they were in gme and etc. 

Now good thing about this is when I say ZOM needs to give a reason for shorts to return, it‚Äôs a good thing because it always comes in PAIRS, because shorts don‚Äôt just return shares for no reason...because if ZOM can make a move to make the price go to 1.25-1.50, I am sure this will in turn lead to some shorts to return their shares which will spike it up closer to 2$...

But if there‚Äôs no reason to cover, they won‚Äôt cover... Management needs to drop a bomb and they‚Äôll start covering...and only the very aggressive ones will stay if anything

Getting back to 2/3 dollars relys more on ZOM doing something and making a move, rather than short shares just being returned.

also if ZOM can make some spicy moves, the MM will raise the short share borrow rate, making it more risky for them, but until then ZOM is unfortunately a VERY comfortable short position for whoever has one

Edit:.  It's finally showing now.  I've been trying since last Friday and finally after I make a post about it of course its fixed.  It was strangely showing the max loss incorrectly or not at all for a few days.",negative

It's a cesspool of ""get rich quick"" folks with little to no actual understanding of markets, finance or investing.

Diversify and DCA is the ""secret"" to success.  Read a fucking book.  Yet all the know-it-alls preach everything in between as if they have some magic bullet style to making money.

I have buddies IRL who think they ""can beat the market YoY"" yet they only started investing their Covid checks in 2020.  If that's the case, why are you pounding cigs working construction and not managing a multi-billion dollar hedge fund?

There's a sentiment that Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, Palantir, make up a diversified portfolio.  Then \[insert pikachu face\] when tech drops and they're down 30%.

Or how about these morons who think ""long term"" is a few weeks or months.  Bitch I've been in VTI for 11 years and plan to stay for at least another 20.

Investing for the common man is a way to save money and shave years or decades off of retirement.  It's not suppose to allow a 25 year old to flip $100 into 50x, 1000x, or 10,000x gains in a couple months.  Buy a fuckin lottery ticket if that's what you want.  Budget $50 or $100 out of your paycheck every week, save $150,000 over 30 years and watch it balloon to over 1 million for retirement.

Most of us will be working until we're in our 50s or 60s.  You want be the nice house grandparents, with the fancy dining room and furniture you can't sit on.  The ones who give the grandkids cash every holiday.  Pay for entire extended family's trip to disney world grandparents.  Or you wanna be the ""lets go visit grandpa and make sure he's got enough food"" style of grandparents.  Still working at 78 style of grandparent?

Retiring at 58 vs 78 is monumental.  That's 20 fucking years, about 25% of a lifetime to enjoy spending and not working.

The retard's YOLO'ing are mostly going to be working until they die.  Investing isn't a shortcut to retire at 26, you have to actually contribute to society.  Watching a few line graphs and shitposting doesn't entitle you to lambos, high end escorts, and wave runners in the Bahamas for the rest of your life.

If you have bills coming up, and whether markets go up or down determine whether you cash out or not...MAKE A FUCKING BUDGET.  Yo dickhead, electric is due every month.  Deduct that from future paychecks.  You should probably eat everyday too.  Budget that.  Budget all your essentials.  What's left should go into an emergency fund.  After that....now pay off debt.  After that, stick it into tax advantaged accounts like an IRA or 401K.  AFTER ALL THAT, then you can speculate.

It's pretty clear to be honest what's going on? Certain financial players have overshorted GME to oblivion. GME has been transforming and people have bought so much of the stock that it's impossible to cover the shorts. Because no one is selling their actual shares.

Synthetic shares are created to provide shares, this is done through more shorting. They have doubled down, doubled down again and doubled down again. They are shoveling their way out of a meteor sized crater. It's hilarious.

All the while, the US Treasury Bonds are being shorted to oblivion as well, because the rehypothecation market is on the verge of collapse. I believe last Friday they provided banks with 391 BILLION in overnight liquidity to accommodate all their actions/positions/liquidity checks. It is slowly, but surely falling apart. 

When it does fall apart, one of two things will happen (or both, I dno). Hyperinflation (unlikely, dollar would tank, USA would lose World Reserve Currency status etc) or Interest rates go way up. If the interest rates go up... Financial players are shafted, because their once 0% loans will now actually cost hundreds of millions a day. 

Margin calls will start happening and the whole short chain will be unraveled, with shares being force bought up at market price. Guess who decides market price? We do. Retail and other long financial players that want to sell their shares when it actually pops.

What if I told you there is a company who has a decent customer base and is built to do this exact thing but has only been running at 10% efficiency off of boomer business practices.. Ryan Cohen's bread and butter.. customer retention.. you work for your customers and the customers work for you,  much like investing..

This is my point the tech boom will never end, why the fuck would it? Are we gonna sit on tiktok for the next 10 years.. no, some 13 year old right now is programming some VR MINE CRAFT type game based on crypto. Tech is about to fucking moon altogether.. the stonk wars isn't about just a crash, it's about the fucking pie being baked in the oven. We get a piece of the pie but the war is about who owns the fucking OVEN.",negative

This is different than let's say, you go to Ralphs and it's you interacting with a cashier terminal. So you can buy up all the apples in the store with dollars. So now the store has too many dollars? And not enough apples. So, cashier terminal says hey! No more apples for dollars are available! In order for trading to continue, humans have to remove dollars and put more apples in the store. 

Let's go up one step closer to Uniswap. So let's say you're using a market maker to trade stock with. You're on Robinhood, you want to buy a ton of GameStop. Everyone around you rushes Robinhood and wants to buy GameStop. Now Robinhood is worried that they will run out of GME to sell to people? So Robinhood shuts down trading for a day.

This happens with centralized crypto exchanges sometimes too! Large swings in trading volume can shut down trading for hours, or a day... 

So what makes Uniswap different? Well is decentralized. It's just your computer interacting with a program on the blockchain.

Uniswap doesn't have a body of people that can just shut down trades. So how do we ensure that trading can continue, no matter what happens in the market?

These users contribute dollars and apples to the stock in equal amounts, so that the pool of dollars/apples is always equal. That ensures that we will always have enough dollars and apples in stock for people to trade with. 

But, we also have to reward users for doing this, because otherwise they won't want to lock up their dollars and apples in our pool. Sometimes dollars might be worth more than apples, and sometimes apples might be worth more than dollars. It's probably not just 1D to 1A. So, Susie comes around and she wants to buy apples. The dollar/apple exchange rate has gone up to 1D/2A. So now Susie gets 2 apples for her 1 dollar.  Uh oh look, market volatility happens and the rate goes back to 1D/1A. Now that means there's too many dollars in the pool! So people providing liquidity to the pool now get the reward of the excess dollars.. split up among everyone contributing of course.

Alright it's actually super simple. It's supply and demand, at the end of the day. These hedgefunds? The contracts they opened allow the risk to be infinite. As in, a stock they are shorting can only go to zero. But a stock can rise and rise and rise into infinity. These hedgefunds NEED your shares. They don't want them, they NEED them. Our shares are the only shares on the world they can use. Our shares are the only shares in the world that they MUST buy. They MUST cover their shorts positions in the end. If everybody except you and me sold shares, and we had the absolute last 100k shares? We set the price. It goes for the larger scale. We. Set. The. Price. They need those 100k shares. They will do anything for these shares. They want to pay us 1000 dollars. We say no. They must buy them still. They say 10k, we say no. 50k? No. 100k? No. We said 500k, we will get 500k. They need our shares to cover. Rinse and repeat until we reach a number so high that it doesn't hurt our brains, but it hurts the hedgefunds brains. Again, their risks are infinite. They agreed to the loss equal to infinity if the stock were to rise.

So, the hedgefunds have assets. When they get margin called, they will have ALL OF THEIR ASSETS LIQUIDATED TO COVER their short positions. There are multiple hedgefunds that are shorting AMC, so we can take their money from liquidation too. I don't know the number but obviously billions and billions. After the hedgefunds money runs out, there's a 50t-70t dollar reinnsurance that pays out to us. I didn't want to say this but I feel like leaving it out is kind of shilly and manipulative, I have no idea where the money comes from if it reaches that point. Maybe the government steps in and prints money? You have to remember it's not just AMC that's gonna squeeze. The GME/AMC squeezes will be the absolute largest transfer of wealth in the history of the world. And probably the largest transfer of wealth in the future of the world is. That's a big if, but I believe it.

From what I hear, ultimately the hedgefunds aren't in control after the margin call. I believe a clearing house goes through and buys all the shares. It's most likely done by a computer. set alerts in your app for the prices. If you set them correctly your phone will blow the fuck up when the squeeze happens. Do your own DD on setting sell limits and all that. I dont know enough to speak about that. Also, the floor is 500k and we sell at 500k on the way down. And that means that we hold and hold and hold. Through 1k all the way to the floor price. Once we the floor price? Right now that's our floor. That's when we sell. But only sell on the way down, the opposite side. This prevents it from making the floor lower (from giving the clearing house CHEAP CHEAP shares for the hedgefunds. We don't want that.

In interviews his investment style is to go all in!  he only owns two stocks after he sold CHewy, Wells Fargo and Apple.

He has been waiting for years for a new opportunity, he turned down many other things.  He is not just going to own 12%.  he is throwing him self into it.  he is going to transform GME.

so this whole time i was like when is he going to buy more, what is he waiting for....was he waiting for the ATM offering, or the board meeting.....

then I realized buying more stock doesnt give GME more capital and they are going to need capital....even more than the 555 million.

its going to be a merger with RC ventures (or another shell company) Ryan and even someone of his other investors can load it up with capital, merge with GME at the appropriate stock price.  Board votes....maybe we would need to vote as well (we are voting YES)

Alright it's actually super simple. It's supply and demand, at the end of the day. These hedgefunds? The contracts they opened allow the risk to be infinite. As in, a stock they are shorting can only go to zero. But a stock can rise and rise and rise into infinity. These hedgefunds NEED your shares. They don't want them, they NEED them. Our shares are the only shares on the world they can use. Our shares are the only shares in the world that they MUST buy. They MUST cover their shorts positions in the end. If everybody except you and me sold shares, and we had the absolute last 100k shares? We set the price. It goes for the larger scale. We. Set. The. Price. They need those 100k shares. They will do anything for these shares. They want to pay us 1000 dollars. We say no. They must buy them still. They say 10k, we say no. 50k? No. 100k? No. We said 500k, we will get 500k. They need our shares to cover. Rinse and repeat until we reach a number so high that it doesn't hurt our brains, but it hurts the hedgefunds brains. Again, their risks are infinite. They agreed to the loss equal to infinity if the stock were to rise.

So, the hedgefunds have assets. When they get margin called, they will have ALL OF THEIR ASSETS LIQUIDATED TO COVER their short positions. There are multiple hedgefunds that are shorting AMC, so we can take their money from liquidation too. I don't know the number but obviously billions and billions. After the hedgefunds money runs out, there's a 50t-70t dollar reinnsurance that pays out to us. I didn't want to say this but I feel like leaving it out is kind of shilly and manipulative, I have no idea where the money comes from if it reaches that point. Maybe the government steps in and prints money? You have to remember it's not just AMC that's gonna squeeze. The GME/AMC squeezes will be the absolute largest transfer of wealth in the history of the world. And probably the largest transfer of wealth in the future of the world is. That's a big if, but I believe it.

From what I hear, ultimately the hedgefunds aren't in control after the margin call. I believe a clearing house goes through and buys all the shares. It's most likely done by a computer. set alerts in your app for the prices. If you set them correctly your phone will blow the fuck up when the squeeze happens. Do your own DD on setting sell limits and all that. I dont know enough to speak about that. Also, the floor is 500k and we sell at 500k on the way down. And that means that we hold and hold and hold. Through 1k all the way to the floor price. Once we the floor price? Right now that's our floor. That's when we sell. But only sell on the way down, the opposite side.

I‚Äôm also lucky because Gme came along and helped my average weekly return tremendously, and without it I‚Äôd be at around 0.4% per week. 

Also I‚Äôm aware that I‚Äôve been playing on easy mode. Stonks only went up this past months. I know I‚Äôve been lucky and could‚Äôve been wiped out any moment. Always keep in mind that there are tons of very smart people who spent a ton of time learning, with tons of world class resources who are playing this game. You don‚Äôt have to be extremely brilliant but do expect to put in the work, learn, reflect, control emotions etc. if it was easy, everyone would be doing it lol.

I play with a fairly small amount of money so losses weren‚Äôt too stressful. But if I were putting in a much larger amount of money, on margin, and I was relying on this money for a living, I‚Äôd be way too stressed. Bad weeks do happen and it‚Äôll wipe away weeks and weeks of returns.",0.9849,9,"options:9:I had those same questions ~9 months ago. I‚Äôm on week 31 of selling options and I averaged about 0.8% per week. When I started, I had a solid understanding of the Greeks but being able to use that knowledge to guide your decisions takes time. Check out thetagang on Reddit. I learn a lot from that sub. Also I used tastytrades (on YouTube). Importantly, prepare to study hard.

1. Gamestop mints X amount of GME coins and divide it among known shareholders.
2. Shorters cannot mint GME coins so in order to fulfill their obligations, they have to BUY SHARES they are responsible for creating synthetically, and give them back. They sort this mess they created
3. Diamondhanded apes dont want to sell their shares under an unprecedented but reasonable ammount of $.
4. Apes get their crypto coin as a medal of Honor, and sell their shares / keep their shares because they like the stock
